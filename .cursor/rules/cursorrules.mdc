# Cursor Rules – React 18 × AWS Amplify (Claude-Sonnet)

## Target stack
- React **18.2** (latest stable, fully supported by AWS Amplify UI v3).
- React-DOM **18.2**.
- aws-amplify **^6**.
- TypeScript ≥ 4.9.

## Coding conventions
1. Only functional components + React Hooks; **no class components**.
2. Prefer Amplify UI React components & DataStore; avoid custom state libs unless justified.
3. Use async/await; avoid promise chaining.
4. Keep components ≤ 200 LOC; extract logic hooks.

## Project layout (src/)
```
components/   reusable UI blocks (PascalCase)
pages/        route-level views (PascalCase)
lib/          shared helpers & Amplify clients (camelCase files)
```

## Tooling
- ESLint (react/recommended, @typescript-eslint/recommended).
- Prettier (2-space indent, single quotes, semi-colon).  Run on commit.
- Vitest + React Testing Library; strive for ≥ 90 % coverage on business logic.

## CI/CD (Amplify Console)
```bash
npm ci
npm run test -- --run
npm run build
```

## Don'ts
- Don't mutate props or state directly.
- Don't commit secrets; use Amplify env vars (+ .gitignore).
- Don't introduce breaking changes to Amplify generated files; use `amplify push` instead.
